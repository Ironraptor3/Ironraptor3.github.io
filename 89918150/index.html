        If you've made it here, I can tell you are trustworthy and resourceful. I suppose I owe you an explanation. I was once a member of Sun Seekers, one of the first, in fact. <br />
        I worked with Mr. Verecourt as his head of research. Caught up in his fervent rhetoric, I worked zealously to find a way to <br />
        summon these higher beings, studying the eldritch writings of countless occultists the world over. The final result of my <br />
        research was a summoning ritual that would be able to anchor the entities in our reality, leading to the Sun Seekers’s <br />
        supposed salvation… <br /><br />
      
        Then it happened. While working out the final details of the ritual, something went wrong, and I saw a glimpse of them… <br />
        just a glimpse beyond the veil of reality. What I saw was more terrifying and unknowable than anything on Earth. I knew, <br />
        at that very moment, that Mr. Verecourt was tampering with forces beyond anything he could even begin to comprehend. <br /><br />
      
        I fled the Sun Seekers shortly afterward, but they’ve tracked my every move. I’ve given the instructions for stopping the ritual to <br />
        Mx. C-Well, who will be able to help you more than I can at this point. Just make sure to follow Sun Seekers’s every move… <br /><br />
